> You need to have expo installed. In case you don't, just run
`npm i expo-cli -g`, and then create an account in [expo](https://expo.io/) and use it
in `expo login`.

- `cp config.example.js config.js`
- Install dependencies `yarn install | npm install`
- Run expo `yarn start | npm run start`

If needed, data can be seeded using `yarn seed | npm run seed` in `/api`.
